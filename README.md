harmotap
========

Customized Bootstrap 3 theme that is slightly flatter.

Usage
========

You can use pre-built css files or you can build it with grunt. Before running grunt, do:
* `` git submodule update `` 
* `` npm install ``
To build css and doc assets run:
* `` grunt ``
To quickly preview the theme, you can build docs site with jekyyl, which will run a little server on port 9001:
* `` jekyll --server ``

Future
========

This theme is only a slight variation from Bootstrap 3, but I hope that my future work will make Harmotap more distinct in its own way - stay in the loop!
